/**
 * Create a reusable S3 client.
 *
 * â€“ In production we generally rely on the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
 *   environment variables being provided at build-time/runtime. If they are not supplied
 *   (e.g. in local development when the user might be using an AWS profile or automatic
 *   credentials via `aws-vault` / `aws sso login`) we fall back to the default credential
 *   provider chain used by the AWS SDK v3 by **omitting** the explicit `credentials` field.
 *   This prevents us from accidentally passing `undefined` values which causes signature
 *   generation to throw and results in a 500 from the `upload.createPresignedUrl` endpoint.
