- make it so transcripts give us word level timestamps
- fix the modal worker so it doesn't open two containers and use up hella credits for no reason
- make it so we can upload mulitple videos and ALL get processed by whisper-x in the modal at the same time. each video should have its own seperate transcript but the UI should show the different transcripts and the name of the file
- make it so we have a user login system and users can see their transcripts saved in a gallery

- because we upload videos to amazon web server, that means we should be able to
a. load in videos into the browser
b. load in the related videos transcript into the browser
c. make an experience where we can click on words/segments and skip to that part in the video
d. make a descript like experience where we can edit the video by deleting text, combining and re-arranging segments

- add an AI into the system that can see our FULL transcript bc they get real big
